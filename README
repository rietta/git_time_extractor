EXTRACT REASONABLE TIME RECORDS FROM A GIT REPOSITORY

This tool goes through a GIT repository's commit log and prints a CSV dump of per developer, per day working time based on a few assumptions:

    - A series of commits within a 3 hour window are part of the same development session
    - A single commit (or the first commit of the session) is considered to represent 30 minutes of work time
    - The more frequent a developer commits to the repository while working, the more accurate the time report will be
    
This script is based on previous code published publicly Sharad at http://www.tatvartha.com/2010/01/generating-time-entry-from-git-log/. However, it has been adapted to run without Rails from the command line. The portions of the code written by Rietta are licensed under the terms of the BSD license (see section 3 below).
    
-----------------------------------------
1. Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------

This script is designed to work in Ruby 1.9 from the command line. It does not require Rails, but rather is design to work with pure Ruby and a couple of support gems, namely:

    - git
    - ostruct
    - logger
    - csv

Most of the requirements should be present on your base Ruby install.  However, you will need to first install a git gem.

For example, run the following:

    gem install git
    
-----------------------------------------
2. Running
-----------------------------------------

    cd /path/to/your/repository
    time_extract.rb > time_log.csv
